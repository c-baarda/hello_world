# hello_world

Hi all,

For starters an exercise in using GitHub.
I 'm doing some programming with Arduino for a very small model railroad called Inglenook.
This a shunting puzzle. The layout uses servo-motors to drive switches and uncouplers. Most of my trains run on DCC.
So for this layout I need to make a few servo-motor drivers operated with toggle switches and a kind of throttle that creates DCC commands for the locos.
